        <h2>Principles We Are What We Eat.</h2>
        We are on a mission to create more sustainable delicious foods. We believe that snacking in a sustainable way should be effortless and tasty. We believe in harnessing the power of technology to increase efficiency, reduce waste and improve our relationship
        with planet earth. We believe in science. We value experimentation. We believe that failure is part of the experimentation process. We believe that we can imagine and create better snacks. We value a data-driven gut.
